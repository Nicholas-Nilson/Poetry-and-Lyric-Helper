# Poetry-and-Lyric-Helper

## Intent:
    To create a tool utilizing the combination of multiple lexical databases to aid in the search for words fitting an or all of; syllable count, syllable stresses, and rhyming.
    
## Why?:
    As a hobby song-writer, thesauruses and rhyming dictionaries are tools of necessity but, there are times when resources are scattered and don't have quite what I need. Syllable counts and meter are important pieces to many songwriters and poets. It is with form and constraints that, I believe, the greatest art is made (not by me, but it sure is fun regardless).
