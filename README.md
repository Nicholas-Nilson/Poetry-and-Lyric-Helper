# Poetry-and-Lyric-Helper

## Intent:
    To create a tool utilizing the combination of multiple lexical databases to aid in 
    the search for words fitting an or all of; syllable count, syllable stresses, and rhyming.
    
## Why?:
    As a hobby song-writer, thesauruses and rhyming dictionaries are tools of necessity 
    but, there are times when resources are scattered and don't have quite what I need. 
    Syllable counts and meter are important pieces to many songwriters and poets. 
    It is with form and constraints that, I believe, the greatest art is made (not by me, 
    but it sure is fun regardless).

## Resources Used:
    - Carnegie Melon's Pronouncing Dictionary (CMUdict)
        - There were several options for datasets for filling out the database for this project.
        - Ultimately, CMUdict's implementation of pronunciations & word stresses all on the
            same line made the most sense to me to work with. Discussed further below.
    - Flask
        - Used to create a simple web app rather than stick with command line for the project.
    - Jupyter Notebook and Pandas
        -
